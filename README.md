# Greenbone + Splunk Lab Environment

**Lab Environment Components**

* **Host OS:** Windows 11 Laptop with Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)
* **WSL2 Distro:** Ubuntu 20.04
* **Virtualization:** Docker Compose 
* **Applications:**
    * Splunk Enterprise Free Trial (Windows)

      - Add-on for Greenbone Community Edition
    * Greenbone Vulnerability Management (Community Edition) - deployed as a multi-container setup on Docker Compose

## Deployment Steps
- [x] The Splunk Enterprise Free Trial is deployed on Windows 11
- [x] Docker Compose is deployed on Ubuntu within the Windows Subsystem for Linux
- [x] Greenbone Vulnerability Management is deployed in Docker Compose on the Ubuntu system 
- [x] Add both of the Splunk Integration Apps for Greenbone within Splunk Enterprise
- [x] I recommend restarting your Splunk Enterprise deployment after installing both Greenbone Splunk Apps 
- [x] Create a TCP Listener on Splunk to receive traffic from Greenbone
- [x] Create an index named gvm_index and add that to your listener. 

You can find more information on creating the listener in Splunk at the following link.
